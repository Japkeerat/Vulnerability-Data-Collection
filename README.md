# Vulnerability Data Collection

This repository contains the code for an ETL Pipeline that extracts data from the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds), transforms into a format that would be usable for Data Analytics and Data Science purposes and loads it into a PostgreSQL database. Further, it updates the [OSS Vulnerabilities](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/japkeeratsingh/oss-vulnerabilities/) dataset on Kaggle that I maintain.
